Working on a team designing and building a high power motor controller from scratch to drive 200kW of power. We spent over a year researching and prototyping. Most prototagss ending in flashes of sparks and smoke, with our final prototags (mostly) working until it overheated. The project ended up being scrapped due to bigger and better projects that need to be completed.
