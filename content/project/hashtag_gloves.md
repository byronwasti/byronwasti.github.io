Gloves that let you tweet by simply tapping your fingers together in a \"hashtag\" shape and then speaking. Developed over the course of 24 hours at Hack Holyoke, these silly gloves managed to gain some traction in the media and have been featured on Gizmodo, Buzzfeed and a whole variety of other websites.
