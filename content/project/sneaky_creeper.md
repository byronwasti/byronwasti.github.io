A data-exfiltration pen-testing program developed in Python that targets social-media. The program and exfiltrate data on a host machine and avoid detection by posting to sites such as Twitter, Soundcloud and Google Docs. It can then collect the data from these sites onto another machine. We were invited to present this project at BSides Las Vegas.",
