The Prusto Watch is an Open Source smart watch with firmware written in Rust, or at least it will be that one day. Currently, the Prusto Watch is just a concept. I plan on writing a series of blog posts documenting my progress in developing the watch, with a focus on going through my thought process. A large goal of this project is to help document the current state of embedded development in Rust, since currently there is not a lot out there.</description>
