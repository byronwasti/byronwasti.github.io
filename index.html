<div id="revo-can" class="section level2 project">
<h2>REVO CAN</h2>
<p>REVO is the Olin College of Engineering's Electric Car Racing team. I am working on, and leading, the CAN programming subsection of the team. Our goal is to have all componenets of our fSAE car able to talk to each other.</p>

<div id="revo-can-tutorials" class="section level2 project">
<h2>REVO CAN Tutorials</h2>
<p>Tutorials I wrote in order to help teach new members of the REVO Electric Vehicle Racing team how to work with ATmegas, and how to program them in C. Originally meant to be a very short introduction, the tutorials were very popular and I have continued to add more of them as I learn new things myself.</p>

<div id="funnl" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Funnl</h2>
<p>A news aggregator website with a twist. Given an input topic, it will scrape different articles and find the most relevant and interesting information and display it. The goal is to reduce the amount of repetitive information found in different articles about the same topic, and to bring out the interesting facts or opinions that different sources bring to the table. Developed over 24 hours at Hack MIT.</p>

<div id="sneaky-creeper" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Sneaky Creeper</h2>
<p>A data-exfiltration pen-testing program developed in Python that targets social-media. The program and exfiltrate data on a host machine and avoid detection by posting to sites such as Twitter, Soundcloud and Google Docs. It can then collect the data from these sites onto another machine. We were invited to present this project at BSides Las Vegas.</p>

<div id="self-tuning-guitar" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Self-Tuning Guitar</h2>
<p>An attachement for a guitar that allows six servos to automatically tune a guitar as you strum it. It uses only an Arduino to control all the servos and to do all the frequency calculations. Built with four others for a final class project.</p>

<div id="kyzr" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Kyzr</h2>
<p>A full-stack Web-application which interfaced with an Android App that allowed users to trade virtual torches on their phones and lookup where their torch has been on the website. The goal of the project was to use as many buzzwords as possible. The server consisted of Python Flask, Apache, Debian, MongoDB. Built with three others for a class final project.</p>

<div id="revo-motor-controller" class="section level2 project">
<h2>REVO Motor Controller</h2>
<p>Working on a team designing and building a high power motor controller from scratch to drive 200kW of power. We spent over a year researching and prototyping. Most prototagss ending in flashes of sparks and smoke, with our final prototags (mostly) working until it overheated. The project ended up being scrapped due to bigger and better projects that need to be completed.</p>

<div id="uber-instant" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Uber Instant</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is just too difficult to pull out your phone and call an Uber. We built a little box with a screen on it that allows you to simply press a button and say where you want to go and it will order an Uber for you. Built over 24 hours at a Hack Holyoke Hackathon and got 2nd place.</p>

<div id="d-scanner" class="section level2 project">
<h2>3D Scanner</h2>
<p>A partner and I designed, built and programmed a 3D scanner with 2 hobby servos and an IR distance sensor. It used an Arduino to take measurements and to control the servos, and interfaced via serial to a computer that rendered the measurements in real-time with Python.</p>

<div id="tracky-bird" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Tracky Bird</h2>
<p>A clone of the popular Flappy Bird game that requires players to actually flap their arms. This project was built in Python with two others for a class project. I mostly focused on the OpenCV flap-detection.</p>

<div id="hashtag-gloves" class="section level2 project">
<h2>Hashtag Gloves</h2>
<p>Gloves that let you tweet by simply tapping your fingers together in a &quot;hashtag&quot; shape and then speaking. Developed over the course of 24 hours at Hack Holyoke, these silly gloves managed to gain some traction in the media and have been featured on Gizmodo, Buzzfeed and a whole variety of other websites.</p>

<h2>Electronic Inchworm Toy</h2>
<p>A rather large Inchworm toy that &quot;inches&quot; along the floor using a servo, with the goal to role as many ping-pong balls underneath it before it reaches the end mark. It was developed for 4th graders as part of a class project.</p>
