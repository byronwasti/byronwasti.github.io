      <description>In this post I will describe my initial dive into Arm development using Rust. There are potentially many mistakes in my understanding, so this post should not be used as a reference for how to do embedded development in Rust. However, I think it is useful to describe the learning process being new to Rust and Arm development so that those more experienced can see the pain-points of getting started.</description>

      <description>Code Repo is here: https://github.com/byronwasti/prusto-watch
Hardware Repo is here: https://github.com/byronwasti/prusto-watch-hardware
The Prusto Watch is an Open Source smart watch with firmware written in Rust, or at least it will be that one day. Currently, the Prusto Watch is just a concept. I plan on writing a series of blog posts documenting my progress in developing the watch, with a focus on going through my thought process. A large goal of this project is to help document the current state of embedded development in Rust, since currently there is not a lot out there.</description>
