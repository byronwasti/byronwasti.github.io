<p>The Prusto Watch is an Open Source smart watch with firmware written in Rust, or at least it will be that one day. Currently, the Prusto Watch is just a concept. I plan on writing a series of blog posts documenting my progress in developing the watch, with a focus on going through my thought process. A large goal of this project is to help document the current state of embedded development in Rust, since currently there is not a lot out there.</p>

<p>Before I dive into the details, this post will be an overview of what this project will entail.</p>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>

<p>The Prusto Watch is going to have only basic features of a smart watch, and will not be running a full OS such as Android or iOS. The core features that are needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity: Ideally BLE for simple phone connectivity</li>
<li>Screen: Low-power OLED or E-ink</li>
<li>IMU: Accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer (for compass functionality)</li>
<li>Vibration: Small vibration motor for notifications</li>
<li>User input: Capacitive-touch &ldquo;ring&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously different users will require different functionality, and since this will be an open source project, anyone is free to fork the project and add additional features. There are also a few features which are pretty broad, such as user input. This could be buttons, it could be a touchscreen, or it could even be voice-processing. For this project I am planning on having a small ring around the screen which will be able to detect the users fingers using capacitive touch.</p>

<h2 id="overall-goals-of-the-project">Overall Goals of the Project</h2>

<p>The project has two overarching goals.</p>

<p>First, the project will attempt to utilize as much open-source software and hardware as possible. This will lower the bar of entry for people who want to hack on the project.</p>

<p>Second, the project will attempt to use bleeding-edge Rust embedded best-practices. This will bring a lot of headaches with it, considering the fact that a lot of the embedded work in Rust is rapidly evolving. However, by keeping up with the bleeding-edge design this project will be a good test-case for all of the work done.</p>
