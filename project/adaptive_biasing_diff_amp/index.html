    <h1>Adaptive Biasing Differential Amplifier</h1>
    <p>This was my final project for a circuits class. It is the design for an adaptive-biasing differential amplifier. This means that the slew-rate will increase if the differential inputs are far apart from each other, which overall increases the speed of the differential amplifier.</p>

<p>The following graph shows the comparison of the slew-rates between the adaptive-biasing differential amplifier, and a differential-amplifier that does not have the adaptive-biasing circuitry (which was from Lab 9).

<p>The following plot shows the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) of the adaptive-biasing differential amplifier. Due to the adaptive-biasing, the VTC curve is not completely symmetric and is not easily described by a function.
